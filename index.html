        <p>Your birthday is one of the most important days of the year for me, because today one of my bestfriends was born. We are born with
          family, but we get to choose our friends, and in my opinion anyone who makes the cut
          is truly special. I consider myself fortunate to have you as a friend. I love you everyday. Happy Haps!</p>
